![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)

> **Autumn internship project** exploring the integration of physical reasoning capabilities into vision-language-action models.  
> Final goal: NeurIPS 2025 Workshop, ICLR 2026 Workshop, or ICRA 2026 submission.

This repository was developed using methodologies suggested by the Qwen (Qwen3-235-A22B-2507, 2025) language model.

## Problem Statement

Current vision-language-action (VLA) models excel at pattern recognition but lack explicit understanding of physical principles, leading to brittle behavior when faced with novel dynamics or out-of-distribution scenarios. While physics-informed neural networks can embed conservation laws, they struggle to process raw visual inputs and language instructions. This disconnect prevents AI systems from developing human-like physical reasoning capabilities that combine data-driven learning with symbolic physics knowledge. Our project addresses this gap by developing frameworks that integrate differentiable physics simulation with multimodal understanding to create physically empowered VLA models that can perform "what-if" reasoning and generate physically plausible actions.

- Week 8: Prepare workshop paper draft focusing on physics integration methodology and initial results

### Project B: Hybrid Causal Reasoning Agent

**Description**: Develop Model#2 - a language-guided causal inference agent that performs "what-if" reasoning under uncertainty using lightweight simulation. This project focuses on fine-tuning LLMs for physics reasoning and implementing the plan-sketch-refine loop that enables human-like physical understanding.

**Milestones**:

### Project D: Physics-Empowered Evaluation Framework

**Description**: Develop comprehensive evaluation metrics and benchmarking tools for physics-aware VLA models. This project focuses on creating standardized tests that measure physical understanding, out-of-distribution generalization, and safety compliance beyond traditional task completion metrics.

**Milestones**:
- Week 1-2: Survey existing VLA and physics reasoning benchmarks
- Week 3-4: Design new evaluation metrics for physical plausibility and causal reasoning
- Week 5-6: Implement benchmark suite with failure mode analysis capabilities
- Week 7: Run comparative evaluation on OpenVLA, Model#1, and Model#2
- Week 8: Prepare workshop paper draft focusing on evaluation methodology and comparative results

## End Goal

The final deliverable for each project is a concise workshop paper (4-6 pages) suitable for submission to A* conferences. Each paper should:
- Document the proposed methodology and implementation details
- Present quantitative results against relevant baselines
- Include analysis of failure cases and limitations
- Discuss implications for physically grounded AI and potential applications
- Propose future research directions

Successful projects may be combined into a full conference paper submission for NeurIPS 2025, ICLR 2026, or ICRA 2026.
